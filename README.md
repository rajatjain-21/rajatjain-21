I am a software engineer building Microsoft Teams Search. I have been employed in the industry for 3+ years now and have been teaching and mentoring students and professionals for over 5 years now. 

I specialize in frontend technologies. I blog about web development and software engineering [here](https://rajatexplains.com). I love solving real life problems and thinking and explaining concepts in terms of metaphors.
